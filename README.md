# Web for Internet of Things

## Intro
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical terminals,
“objects”, which integrate sensors, software and other technologies in order to
connect to other terminals and systems on the Internet and exchange data with them.
This interconnection and these data exchanges are carried out via a protocol or
client–server environment which designates a mode of transaction (often through
a network) between several programs or processes: one, called a client, sends
queries; the other, called a server, waits for client requests and responds to them. \
 \
 
This project consists of creating a `chat application` based on a client-server architecture and in which the exchange of messages is done through the TCP/IP or websocket protocols. This project is broken down into use cases which are distinguished either by the protocol used or by the equipment (computer or ESP32), both on the client side and on the server side. \
 \

## List of use cases
We have created the following four (04) use cases: \
- Client Node JS / Server Node JS over TCP/IP \
- Client Node JS / Server Node JS over websocket \
- Client Node JS/ Server ESP32 over TCP/IP \
- Client ESP32 / Server Node JS over TCP/IP \
 \
 \
The complete presentation of the project can be found in the file `IoT - chat system.pdf` \
You will find for each of the use cases, the implemented features , the explanation of the operation as well as the formats of the
messages sent by the client and the server.
In this document you will also find screenshots of the application in operation. \
